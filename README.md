T2A2 API Webserver Project

R1	Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.
- Roaster Connect exists to connect local coffee roasters and customers looking for single origin coffee beans that are roasted locally. It is an easy to use platform that allows roasters to post what beans they have available, including the variety and flavour notes, while also allowing customers to order specific beans in whatever quanitity, grind, and roast they'd like. The roasters then fufill this order and mail it to the user. 

R2	Why is it a problem that needs solving?
- While there are many local coffee roasters, it is sometimes difficult to tell what coffee beans they have avaialble on any given day, especially if the roaster doesn't have a strong online presence. Additionally sometimes the same variety grown in a different area can have a slightly different flavour profile. This app allows for clear, standardised criteria from roasters without overloading the customer with information. 

R3 Why have you chosen this database system. What are the drawbacks compared to others?
- I've chosen PostgreSQL as it's a well known database management system that supports a large amount of SQL syntax and allows unstructured data handling, allowing PostgreSQL to work with multiple languaged. As this app is written using Python and utilses JSON for returning information, having a DBMS that supports multiple languages was necessary.
